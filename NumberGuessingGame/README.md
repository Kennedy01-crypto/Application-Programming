# Random Number Guessing Game

This repository contains implementations of a simple number guessing game in five different programming languages: Python, Java, C, JavaScript, and C# (more languages may be added soon). All implementations serve the same purpose, allowing users to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

## Overall Workflow

1. The user is welcomed and informed about the game rules.
2. A random number between 0 and 99 is generated for the user to guess.
3. The user has 7 chances to guess the number.
4. Feedback is provided on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. If the user guesses the number correctly, their score is calculated based on the number of attempts taken.
6. If the user fails to guess the number within the allowed attempts, the correct number is revealed.

## Conclusion

All implementations demonstrate the same core functionality of a number guessing game, showcasing how the same logic can be applied across different programming languages. Each implementation has its own syntax and libraries, but the overall structure and flow of the game remain consistent.
