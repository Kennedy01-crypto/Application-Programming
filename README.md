# Random Number Guessing Game

This repository contains implementations of a simple number guessing game in three different programming languages: Python, Java, and C (more languages may be added soon). All implementations serve the same purpose, allowing users to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

## Overview of Implementations

### 1. RandomNumberGuess.py (Python)

- **Description**: This is the Python implementation of the number guessing game.
- **Features**:
  - Welcomes the user and explains the game.
  - Generates a random number between 0 and 99.
  - Allows the user to make 7 guesses.
  - Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
  - Displays the correct number if the user fails to guess it within the allowed attempts.

### 2. RandomNumberGuess.java (Java)

- **Description**: This is the Java implementation of the number guessing game.
- **Features**:
  - Similar to the Python version, it welcomes the user and explains the game.
  - Uses the `Random` class to generate a random number between 0 and 99.
  - Utilizes `Scanner` for user input.
  - Allows the user to make 7 guesses with feedback on each guess.
  - Displays the correct number if the user fails to guess it within the allowed attempts.

### 3. RandomNumberGuess.c (C)

- **Description**: This is the C implementation of the number guessing game.
- **Features**:
  - Follows the same logic as the Python and Java versions.
  - Uses standard input/output for user interaction.
  - Generates a random number and allows the user to guess it with feedback.

### 4. RandomNumberGuessGame.cs (C#)

- **Description**: This is the C# implementation of the number guessing game.
- **Features**:
  - Welcomes the user and explains the game.
  - Generates a random number between 0 and 99.
  - Allows the user to make 7 guesses.
  - Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
  - Displays the correct number if the user fails to guess it within the allowed attempts.

## Conclusion

All three implementations demonstrate the same core functionality of a number guessing game, showcasing how the same logic can be applied across different programming languages. Each implementation has its own syntax and libraries, but the overall structure and flow of the game remain consistent.
